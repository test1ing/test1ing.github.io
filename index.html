							<h1>What is Skilllab?</h1>
							<p>Skilllab is a <b>social venture developing technology-based solutions to facilitate the integration of excluded individuals into local labour markets</b>. We believe that the dignity of independence through work is a fundamental right that functioning labour markets should provide. By taking a new, technology-driven approach toward assessing and matching an individual’s relevant skills to local occupation, Skilllab’s solution, facilitates linkages within labour markets, making them more dynamic and inclusive.</p>
							<h2>Empowering excluded individuals</h2>
							<p>Skilllab empowers people that are excluded from labour markets through <b>a technology-enabled skill assessment process that automatically creates rich, comprehensive skill profiles and job applications</b> based on a person’s past experiences and future ambitions. Our mobile skill assessment application uses a comprehensive data model including over 13,500 individual skills and nearly 3,000 occupations, as well as state of the art artificial intelligence to match individuals to occupations and generate job-specific applications.</p>
							<p>The resulting skill profiles can then be used by individuals, employment services, education institutions, and others, and integrated into existing career and education services.</p>
							<h2>Facilitating Labour Market Linkages</h2>
							<p>Skilllab’s application and data model is based on the European Skills, Competency and Qualifications (ESCO) framework. We use this framework to strengthen the link between individuals, employers, and educators, enabling all actors to map their needs and offerings in form of skills: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Employers can map the exact skill requirements for a position. This is not necessary to receive job applications generated by Skilllab, but if done, candidate matching, and applications are adjusted to the exact needs of the employer.</li>
								<li>Educators can map the sets of skills offered by their training programs.</li>
								<li>Institutions offering validation services can offer their services within Skilllab’s tool enabling individuals to prove informally acquired skills via through certifications embedded in their skill profiles.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This way, Skilllab supports the creation of an ecosystem that provides job-seekers, employers, educators and policy-makers rich insights into the demand for and supply of employable skills.</p>

						<div class="content-textwrapper">
							<h1>Technology for Improved Skill Assessment</h1>
							<p>Skilllab’s service uses an intuitive and engaging smartphone application that allows individuals to capture the range of past experiences and skills acquired in their native language without the need to type. Intelligent algorithms based on a comprehensive data model automatically produce and translate the resulting outputs:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A vivid and comprehensive profile of an individual’s skillset</li>
								<li>A clear report of where an individual’s skillset fits within the labour market</li>
								<li>A delineation of the skill gap between an individual’s skillset and the skillsets required for specific occupations</li>
								<li>Automated job applications for any occupation in the Skilllab data model</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These outputs can then be used by public employment services, civil society organizations, employers, and the individuals themselves to support their career and education planning.</p>

							<h1>What Skilllab offers</h1>
							<p>Skilllab supports a range of public, private, and civil sector organisations in supporting the career aspirations of individuals excluded from labour markets by offering Skill Assessment software to agents providing career and education services to excluded individuals.</p>
							<p>Skilllab’s software removes the major pain points of existing skill assessment processes (see below), thereby increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of existing processes, reducing the time and cost associated with the performance of skill assessments, and providing public servants, employers, and others with rich data to support their individual integration and talent acquisition efforts.</p>
							<img src="/test1ing/_pics/value.png" style="width: auto; height: auto;">							<h2>Performing Detailed Skill Assessments</h2>
							<p>Our application uses a comprehensive data model based on the European Skills/Competencies Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) framework to efficiently develop comprehensive skill profiles of individuals. The data model includes nearly 3,000 common European occupations comprised of over 13,500 individual skills and competencies. The skill assessment process is intuitive and efficient, requiring no typing/writing and consisting of a simple sequential confirmation of skills acquired based on advanced artificial intelligence skill recommendation engines. Ultimately the assessment results in an automatically generated skill profile containing a rich and compelling overview of an individual’s employable skills and suitability for specific occupations.</p>
							<h2>Skill Verification</h2>
							<p>Our application’s engaging application builds on gamification theory to encourage individuals to accurately self-assess the degree to which they have developed specific skills. An algorithm generating experience points (XPs) based on a user’s previous experience automatically limits the range and depth of skills an individual can claim, encouraging individuals to prioritize the reporting of concentrated sets of skills.</p>
							<h2>Translation</h2>
							<p>Even highly skilled individuals can find it immensely difficult to express their skills outside of their native language. Our application is available in 26 recognized languages, allowing users perform skill assessments in their native language and automatically translating the outputs into the relevant language of the local labour market.</p>
							<h2>Occupation matching</h2>
							<p>The Skilllab application leverages a comprehensive data model to automatically assess an individual’s suitability for each of the nearly 3,000 occupations in the data model. Individuals and public servants can therefore see how competitive a person would be in a particular job market, based on that individual’s coverage of the requisite skills, as well as identify the existing skill gaps that can inform a the development of a personalized training/education plan.</p>
							<h2>Generate Skill Profiles and Job Applications</h2>
							<p>Upon completion of a skill assessment, the application automatically generates a personal skill profile detailing an individual’s employable skillset, a summary of how they match to highly suitable occupations, and the remaining skill gap for each profession. The outcome is rich documentation that complements traditional resumes to provide public, private, and civil institutions with a basis to provide personalized training and employment services.</p>
